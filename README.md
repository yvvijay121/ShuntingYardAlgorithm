# Shunting-yard Algorithm
This is a Java implementation of the [Shunting-yard Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shunting-yard_algorithm), an algorithm that parses mathematical expressions in [infix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infix_notation) to [postfix notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation). This implementation currently does not support functions or variables fully.

### Usage 
Run the `Main.java` program; the program will ask the user for a simple mathematical expression in infix notation. The program will then display the input and the output of the algorithm.
